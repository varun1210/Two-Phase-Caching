1: Fill the Status register (As the processes come in)
2: Fill the short term cache 
	2.1) Calculate the average frequencies of the first 10 (f)
	2.2) Populate the short term cache with the processes of frequencies f / 2 (by 	     rank)
	2.3) If we can overpopulate, then take the highest ranked processes
	2.4) If we cannot populate them then we have fill in the decreasing order of 	     	     frequencies till short term cache is full
3: Fill the long term cache:
	3.1) Iterate over all the short term processes and record all the next 	     	     processes.
	     xi will be the process frequency * frequency of the first process.
	     See if it crosses the threshold.
	3.2) Add all the processes that cross over the threshold. 
	3.3) If there is any space left over, just add the adjacent processes in the 	     	     list again
